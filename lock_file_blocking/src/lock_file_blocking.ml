(* We have reason to believe that lockf doesn't work properly on CIFS mounts.  The idea
   behind requiring both lockf and flock is to prevent programs taking locks on
   network filesystems where they may not be sound.

   However, this assumes that [lockf] and [flock] take independent locks, which
   is true on local Linux filesystems, but is false on many OSes (for example, Mac OS X),
   so we use just [flock] on non-linux OSes and give up the fail-on-CIFS-and-NFS property.

   We prefer [flock] and not [lockf] because [lockf] has bad semantics if used multiple
   times within the same process: for example [lockf a; lockf b; close a] succeeds (bad!)
   and leaves the file unlocked (bad!) if [a] and [b] are unrelated file descriptors for
   the same file. *)
