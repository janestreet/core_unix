  (** [create_ending_after ?zone (od1, od2) ~now] returns the smallest interval [(t1 t2)]
      with minimum [t2] such that [t2 >= now], [to_ofday t1 = od1], and
      [to_ofday t2 = od2]. If a zone is specified, it is used to translate [od1] and [od2]
      into times, otherwise the machine's time zone is used.

      It is not guaranteed that the interval will contain [now]: for instance if it's
      11:15am, [od1] is 12pm, and [od2] is 2pm, the returned interval will be 12pm-2pm
      today, which obviously doesn't include 11:15am. In general [contains (t1 t2) now]
      will only be true when now is between [to_ofday od1] and [to_ofday od2].

      You might want to use this function if, for example, there's a daily meeting from
      10:30am-11:30am and you want to find the next instance of the meeting, relative to
      now. *)

  (** [create_ending_before ?zone (od1, od2) ~ubound] returns the smallest interval
      [(t1 t2)] with maximum [t2] such that [t2 <= ubound], [to_ofday t1 = od1], and
      [to_ofday t2 = od2]. If a zone is specified, it is used to translate [od1] and [od2]
      into times, otherwise the machine's time zone is used.

      You might want to use this function if, for example, there's a lunch hour from noon
      to 1pm and you want to find the first instance of that lunch hour (an interval)
      before [ubound]. The result will either be on the same day as [ubound], if
      [to_ofday ubound] is after 1pm, or the day before, if [to_ofday ubound] is any
      earlier. *)
