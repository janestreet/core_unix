(* These tests check that [Command_unix.shape] returns regardless of the order in which the
   child writes and closes its stderr and stdout.  Returning an error is a successful
   outcome.

   We also used to have some tests where the child process hung and never closed its
   stdout/stderr, but that seems like too rare a failure mode to handle. We've been
   running vulnerable code for years without seeing it. *)
