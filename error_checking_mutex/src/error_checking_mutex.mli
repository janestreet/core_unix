    thread.

(** [try_lock] is like [lock], but always returns immediately. If the calling thread or
    another one already has the mutex it returns [`Already_held_by_me_or_other], otherwise
    it locks it and returns [`Acquired]. *)

      thread. *)

    [f] (or raises if [f] raised). *)

    except that the mutex is held during its execution. *)

(** [update_signal mtx cnd ~f] updates some state within a critical section protected by
    mutex [mtx] using function [f] and signals condition variable [cnd] after finishing.
    If [f] raises an exception, the condition will NOT be signaled! *)

(** [update_broadcast mtx cnd ~f] updates some state within a critical section protected
    by mutex [mtx] using function [f] and broadcasts condition variable [cnd] after
    finishing. If [f] raises an exception, the condition will NOT be broadcast! *)
