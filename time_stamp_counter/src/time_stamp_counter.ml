(* Time stamp counter
   ==================

   This module tries to estimate time based on the CPU time stamp counter (TSC).  The time
   estimates reported by this module are monotonically increasing.  It uses [Time.now ()]
   as its measure of "real time" to do this.

   Historically, the rate of increment of the TSC (sometimes referred to as the TSC
   frequency) varied based of CPU overclocking, temperature, load etc.  On modern Intel
   CPU's the TSC is expected to be stable.  On Linux systems, the "constant_tsc" in
   /proc/cpuinfo indicates that the machine has a stable TSC rate.  While this module
   assumes that the TSC is relatively stable, it can adapt to small variations in the TSC
   frequency.

   Simple Overview
   ===============
   Here is an explanation of how this module works.  The module measures the change in
   real time and the change in TSC at every calibration call and maintains an EWMA of
   these deltas.  It then uses the EWMA values to do linear regression where time is the
   estimated value and TSC is the predictor.  The linear regression done at every
   calibration step produces an updated time/tsc slope.  Using this time/tsc slope and
   the latest value of real time, the module estimates time in terms of tsc.

   Ensuring Monotonicity of Time
   =============================
   The simple picture above is complicated by the presence of noise.  There are two
   significant sources of noise.  The first is the noise caused by variations in the
   frequency of TSC.  The second, and probably the more significant one, is noise in real
   time, i.e. noise in the [Time.now ()] call.

   (1) [Time.now ()] calls suffer from the overhead of transition from the user program to
   a kernel vdso and

   (2) It is affected by NTP updates.

   (3) Another significant source of error comes from loss of precision.  [Time.now]
   reports a 64-bit float of which it has 52 bits of mantissa.  The 52 bits of mantissa
   for time in seconds from Unix epoch only allows for precision in the order of
   micro-seconds.  Consequently the measurement of time using [Time.now] can only be
   precise in the order of micro-seconds.

   Noise in measuring real time and in the rate of time/tsc implies that at each
   calibration point the estimated time "jumps" up or down with respect to the estimate
   value of time before calibration.  In other words, the time estimated using the EWMA
   linear regression is not strictly monotonic.

   We report a monotonic time in terms of the estimated time, by maintaining a separate
   slope called the "monotonic time/TSC slope".  At every calibration point, we take the
   last estimated time and adjust the monotonic time/TSC slope such that it catches up to
   the estimated time in a fixed number of cycles.  If the expected change in slope is too
   high, we bound the rate of change of the monotonic time/TSC slope.  As long as
   monotonic time has not caught up with the estimated time we report time in terms of the
   adjusted monotonic time slope.  Once we have caught up to the estimated time, we start
   reporting the estimated time.

   We can chose the number of cycles to allow for catchup to be any number we wish.  A
   number in the order of 1E6-1E9 TSC steps allows for a gradual catchup rate without too
   many abrupt changes in the rate of reported time.  The bound to rate of change is
   expressed in percentage terms of slope and is at max the ratio by which we expect the
   underlying TSC frequency to change on the machine.  It is defined as
   [max_perc_change_from_real_slope] below.

   It is worth noting that the approximation of the monotonic slope trying to catch up
   with the estimate slope can be achieved in many other ways.  A more principled approach
   to this would be to use a PID controller that adapts to error and gets the reported
   monotonic time to smoothly fit the estimated time.  However PID controllers are
   computationally more expensive and we use a simpler linear approximation.

  (* The rate of response to the variations in TSC frequency can be controlled via alpha.
     Alpha should be in (0,1] and controls the decay of the subsequent EWMA calculation.
     A low number such as 0.01 suggests that the TSC is largely stable and small
     variations should be treated as noise.  Setting this number to 0.6 or higher
     indicates that each new measurement of the TSC should significantly outweigh past
     measurements which has the effect of making time calibration more responsive to
