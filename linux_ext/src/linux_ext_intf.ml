        unacknowledged packet", BSD/Windows and others consider it "1 unacknowledged
        segment of data").

        If Linux determines a connection to be bidirectional, it will delay sending acks,

  module Extended_file_attributes : sig
    (** Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes (files,
        directories, symlinks, etc). They are extensions to the normal attributes which
        are associated with all inodes in the system (i.e. the 'man 2 stat' data). A
        complete overview of extended attributes concepts can be found in 'man 5 attr'.

        [getxattr] retrieves the value of the extended attribute identified by name and
        associated with the given path in the filesystem.

        The [name] includes a namespace prefix - there may be several, disjoint namespaces
        associated with an individual inode. The [value] is a chunk of arbitrary textual
        or binary data.

        If the attribute exists, it is returned as [Ok string]. Several common errors are
        returned as possible constructors, namely:
        - [ENOATTR]: The named attribute does not exist, or the process has no access to
          this attribute.
        - [ERANGE]: The size of the value buffer is too small to hold the result.
        - [ENOTSUP]: Extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are
          disabled.

        Many other errors are possible, and will raise an exception. See the man pages for
        full details. *)

    module Get_attr_result : sig
      type t =
        | Ok of string
        | ENOATTR
        | ERANGE
        | ENOTSUP

    (** [setxattr] sets the value of the extended attribute identified by name and
        associated with the given path in the filesystem.

        [how] defaults to [`Set], in which case the extended attribute will be created if
        need be, or will simply replace the value if the attribute exists. If [how] is
        [`Create], then [setxattr] returns [EEXIST] if the named attribute exists already.
        If [how] is [`Replace], then [setxattr] returns [ENOATTR] if the named attribute
        does not already exist.

        [ENOTSUP] means extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are
        disabled. Many other errors are possible, and will raise an exception. See the man
        pages for full details. *)
