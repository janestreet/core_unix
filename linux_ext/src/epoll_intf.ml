(** epoll(): a Linux I/O multiplexer of the same family as select() or poll(). Its main
    differences are support for Edge- or Level-triggered notifications (we're using
    Level-triggered to emulate "select") and much better scaling with the number of file
    descriptors.

    See the man pages for a full description of the epoll facility. *)

        [sexp_of_t] produces a human-readable list of bits, e.g., "(in out)". *)

  (** An [Epoll.t] maintains a map from [File_descr.t] to [Flags.t], where the domain is
      the set of file descriptors that one is interested in, and the flags associated with
      each file descriptor specify the types of events one is interested in being notified
      about for that file descriptor. Our implementation maintains a user-level table
      equivalent to the kernel epoll set, so that [sexp_of_t] produces useful
      human-readable information, and so that we can present our standard table interface.

      The implementation assumes that one never closes a file descriptor that is the
      domain of an [Epoll.t], since doing so might remove the [fd] from the kernel epoll
      set without the implementation's knowledge.

      An [Epoll.t] also has a buffer that is used to store the set of ready [fd]s returned
      by calling [wait]. *)

      returned in a single call to [wait]. *)

  (** [wait t ~timeout] blocks until at least one file descriptor in [t] is ready for one
      of the events it is being watched for, or [timeout] passes. [wait] side effects [t]
      by storing the ready set in it. One can subsequently access the ready set by calling
      [iter_ready] or [fold_ready].

      With [wait ~timeout:(`After span)], [span <= 0] is treated as [0]. If [span > 0],
      then [span] is rounded to the nearest millisecond, with a minimum value of one
      millisecond.

      Note that this method should not be considered thread-safe. There is mutable state
      in [t] that will be changed by invocations to [wait] that cannot be prevented by
